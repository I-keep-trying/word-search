      "definition": "It is said to have originated from an ancient cave man species, who being born dumb and unable to communicate, etched their messages from flint onto rock or any available flat pieces of stone. The concept of creating pictures because you simply cannot speak has since been lost, in fact very much lost in translation. Society now thinks that there is more to it, when there simply is not. These members of today's society have since imitated the original idea through [finger painting], [cutting vegetables] into shapes and [daubing] them with paint thus transferring to paper and most recently through the innovative 'etchasketch'. Studies show that these people are somewhat mentally deprived, socially inept or just plain gay and therefore add this mentality into their work. They also think that it is more than just a fetish for all things crayola and the ability to use wax crayons and various pastilles.\r\n\r\nAlso: That produced by an \"artist\".  It comes in many forms:painting, pencil-drawing, sculpture, etc.  The medium isn't important as long as the creation is unfathomable to all but the exceedingly rich and outstandingly gay, who only pretend to understand it anyway and write protracted essays on it aimed at the [terminally] dull.  Amongst those 2 classes of people a piece of art will often [engender] much [chin-rubbing] in bizarrely-lit art galleries.  The practitioners of art are invariably pretentious individuals who consider themselves superior to all other people.  In fact some artists take up the occupation in order to further remove themselves from normal, right-thinking people.\r\n",
